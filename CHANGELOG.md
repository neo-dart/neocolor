# CHANGELOG

## 0.1.0

**MISC**:

- Improve test coverage and tweaked the `README`.

**BREAKING CHANGES**:

- Removed value-type semantics from `HSLResult` and `HSBResult`. While useful,
  they defeated the main purpose of these classes - temporary objects to read
  individual `H/S/L/B` values.

## 0.0.0

- Initial release, just includes a single class: `Color`.
